#+TITLE: Add Extra Build Tools to Haskell.nix Project

* Why

Sometimes you will need some extra tools to build your project. For the *RecordDotSyntax* feature,
you will need a ghc plugin or a pre processer to build.

* Cabal build-tool-depends

This flag is used by cabal, but looks like cabal only builds the library but wonâ€™t add the executable
into the *PATH* during the following build process. There is a issue to track this:
https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/8434

* haskell.nix executableToolDepends

There also is a issue track in *haskell.nix*: https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/issues/839
